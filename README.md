# HateSpeechDetector
Towards Safer Social Platforms: A Machine Learning and NLP Approach to Cyberbullying Detection

This project focuses on real-time cyberbullying detection using HateBERT, a transformer-based model fine-tuned for hate speech identification. It analyzes textual content to identify harmful patterns, leveraging packages like pandas, scikit-learn, transformers, and torch. A Flask-based UI enables real-time classification. The system achieves 83% accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness. Future improvements include enhancing detection accuracy, incorporating multimedia analysis, and expanding multilingual capabilities.
